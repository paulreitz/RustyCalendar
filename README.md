## Rusty Calendar

### Why a Calendar
The default windows calendar was getting more and more bloated and kept insisting on linking it to an online account. Finally it got to the point where it doesn't work unless it's linked to an account.

I just want a calendar I can open real quick and look at. No fancy bells and whistles, no fuss: just a calendar.

So I made this one. 

## Building
This project is set up to run and build on Windows. I hadn't planned on running it on any other platform. I did provide a `.png` file along with the `.ico` file if you want to build for another platform.

To build and run this project in dev mode, just use `cargo run`.
